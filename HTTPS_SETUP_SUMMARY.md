# HTTPS Setup Summary for yossigrunwald.com

## What Was Done

1. **HTTPS is Already Active**: Your domain already has HTTPS enabled through GitHub Pages' automatic SSL/TLS certificate provisioning.

2. **Added Automatic HTTPS Redirect**: I added a JavaScript redirect in your `index.html` file that automatically redirects HTTP visitors to HTTPS:
   ```javascript
   if (location.protocol !== 'https:' && location.hostname !== 'localhost') {
     location.replace('https:' + window.location.href.substring(window.location.protocol.length));
   }
   ```

3. **Verified No HTTP Links**: Checked all your files and confirmed there are no hardcoded HTTP links that need updating.

## How It Works

- GitHub Pages automatically provides free SSL certificates for custom domains
- The JavaScript redirect ensures anyone accessing http://yossigrunwald.com is automatically redirected to https://yossigrunwald.com
- The redirect excludes localhost to allow local development

## Verification

You can verify HTTPS is working by:
1. Visit http://yossigrunwald.com - it should redirect to https://
2. Check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar
3. Your SSL certificate is managed automatically by GitHub Pages

## Note

Changes typically take 5-10 minutes to propagate on GitHub Pages after pushing.
